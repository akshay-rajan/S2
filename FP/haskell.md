# Haskell

Haskell is a purely functional programming language.

Features of haskell include
1. All variables are constants - their values cannot be changed
2. Functions have no side effects
3. Referential transparency - a function always returns the same value(s), when called with the same argument(s)
4. Lazy evaluation - defers actually computing results as long as possible

5. Statically Typed - Compiler knows the datatype of each piece of code
6. Type Inference - The datatype is determined by the value stored in a variable
