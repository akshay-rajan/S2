# 1. more
The `more` command in Linux is a utility for viewing text files and command outputs in the terminal, one screenful at a time¹². It's particularly useful for reading large files or long outputs that would otherwise scroll past the screen too quickly².

Here's the basic syntax of the `more` command¹:

```bash
more [options] [file_name]
```

While viewing a file with `more`, you can use the following controls¹:

- **Enter key**: Scroll down line by line.
- **Space bar**: Go to the next page.
- **b key**: Go back one page.

The `more` command also supports a variety of options¹:

- `-d`: Displays help messages for navigation.
- `-f`: Does not wrap long lines.
- `-p`: Clears the screen before displaying text.
- `-c`: Displays pages in the same area by overlapping the previously displayed text.
- `-s`: Squeezes multiple blank lines into one.
- `-u`: Omits underlines.

You can also use `more` in combination with other commands. For example, you can pipe the output of one command into `more` to view it one screenful at a time¹. Here's an example:

```bash
ls -l | more
```

This command will display the long format listing of the current directory's contents, one screenful at a time.

Moreover, `more` allows you to search for a specific string in the text file or command output¹. You can do this by using the `+/pattern` option, where `pattern` is the string you're looking for¹. For example:

```bash
more +/error logfile.txt
```

This command will display the contents of `logfile.txt`, starting from the first occurrence of the string "error".

Despite its usefulness, `more` has a significant limitation: it does not support backward scrolling (except for going back one page)⁵. If you need more advanced features, such as backward scrolling or the ability to scroll left and right, you might want to use the `less` command instead².

In conclusion, the `more` command is a simple yet powerful tool for viewing text files and command outputs in the terminal. It provides a variety of options for customizing the display and supports basic navigation and search features¹².

# 2. less

The `less` command in Linux is a utility for viewing text files and command outputs in the terminal¹². It is similar to `more`, but has more advanced features and allows you to navigate both forward and backward through the file².

Here's the basic syntax of the `less` command¹:

```bash
less [options] [file_name]
```

While viewing a file with `less`, you can use the following controls²:

- **Space bar or f key**: Move forward one page.
- **b key**: Move backward one page.
- **Up arrow, y or k**: Move backward one line.
- **Down arrow, Enter, e, or j**: Move forward one line.
- **/pattern**: Search forward for matching patterns.
- **?pattern**: Search backward for matching patterns.

The `less` command also supports a variety of options¹:

- `-E`: Automatically exit when reaching the end of the file.
- `-F`: Exit if the entire file can be displayed on the first screen.
- `-N`: Shows line numbers.
- `-X`: Leave file contents on screen when less exits.
- `-p pattern`: Start at the first occurrence of the specified pattern in the file.
- `-s`: Squeeze consecutive blank lines into a single line.

You can also use `less` in combination with other commands. For example, you can pipe the output of one command into `less` to view it one screenful at a time¹. Here's an example:

```bash
dmesg | less
```

This command will display the output of the `dmesg` command, one screenful at a time.

Moreover, `less` allows you to search for a specific string in the text file or command output¹. You can do this by using the `/pattern` option, where `pattern` is the string you're looking for¹. For example:

```bash
dmesg | less -p "fail"
```

This command will display the output of `dmesg`, starting from the first occurrence of the string "fail".

In conclusion, the `less` command is a powerful tool for viewing text files and command outputs in the terminal. It provides a variety of options for customizing the display and supports advanced navigation and search features¹².
