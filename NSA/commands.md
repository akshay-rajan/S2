# 1. more
The `more` command in Linux is a utility for viewing text files and command outputs in the terminal, one screenful at a time¹². It's particularly useful for reading large files or long outputs that would otherwise scroll past the screen too quickly².

Here's the basic syntax of the `more` command¹:

```bash
more [options] [file_name]
```

While viewing a file with `more`, you can use the following controls¹:

- **Enter key**: Scroll down line by line.
- **Space bar**: Go to the next page.
- **b key**: Go back one page.

The `more` command also supports a variety of options¹:

- `-d`: Displays help messages for navigation.
- `-f`: Does not wrap long lines.
- `-p`: Clears the screen before displaying text.
- `-c`: Displays pages in the same area by overlapping the previously displayed text.
- `-s`: Squeezes multiple blank lines into one.
- `-u`: Omits underlines.

You can also use `more` in combination with other commands. For example, you can pipe the output of one command into `more` to view it one screenful at a time¹. Here's an example:

```bash
ls -l | more
```

This command will display the long format listing of the current directory's contents, one screenful at a time.

Moreover, `more` allows you to search for a specific string in the text file or command output¹. You can do this by using the `+/pattern` option, where `pattern` is the string you're looking for¹. For example:

```bash
more +/error logfile.txt
```

This command will display the contents of `logfile.txt`, starting from the first occurrence of the string "error".

Despite its usefulness, `more` has a significant limitation: it does not support backward scrolling (except for going back one page)⁵. If you need more advanced features, such as backward scrolling or the ability to scroll left and right, you might want to use the `less` command instead².

In conclusion, the `more` command is a simple yet powerful tool for viewing text files and command outputs in the terminal. It provides a variety of options for customizing the display and supports basic navigation and search features¹².

# 2. less

The `less` command in Linux is a utility for viewing text files and command outputs in the terminal¹². It is similar to `more`, but has more advanced features and allows you to navigate both forward and backward through the file².

Here's the basic syntax of the `less` command¹:

```bash
less [options] [file_name]
```

While viewing a file with `less`, you can use the following controls²:

- **Space bar or f key**: Move forward one page.
- **b key**: Move backward one page.
- **Up arrow, y or k**: Move backward one line.
- **Down arrow, Enter, e, or j**: Move forward one line.
- **/pattern**: Search forward for matching patterns.
- **?pattern**: Search backward for matching patterns.

The `less` command also supports a variety of options¹:

- `-E`: Automatically exit when reaching the end of the file.
- `-F`: Exit if the entire file can be displayed on the first screen.
- `-N`: Shows line numbers.
- `-X`: Leave file contents on screen when less exits.
- `-p pattern`: Start at the first occurrence of the specified pattern in the file.
- `-s`: Squeeze consecutive blank lines into a single line.

You can also use `less` in combination with other commands. For example, you can pipe the output of one command into `less` to view it one screenful at a time¹. Here's an example:

```bash
dmesg | less
```

This command will display the output of the `dmesg` command, one screenful at a time.

Moreover, `less` allows you to search for a specific string in the text file or command output¹. You can do this by using the `/pattern` option, where `pattern` is the string you're looking for¹. For example:

```bash
dmesg | less -p "fail"
```

This command will display the output of `dmesg`, starting from the first occurrence of the string "fail".

In conclusion, the `less` command is a powerful tool for viewing text files and command outputs in the terminal. It provides a variety of options for customizing the display and supports advanced navigation and search features¹².

# 3. find
The `find` command in Linux is a utility for searching files and directories in a directory hierarchy based on different criteria such as name, size, type, and more¹².

Here's the basic syntax of the `find` command¹:

```bash
find [path] [options] [expression]
```

- `path`: The directory to start searching from.
- `options`: Additional settings or conditions for the search.
- `expression`: The search criteria.

The `find` command supports a variety of options¹:

- `-name pattern`: Searches for files with a specific name or pattern.
- `-type type`: Specifies the type of file to search for (e.g., `f` for regular files, `d` for directories).
- `-size [+/-]n`: Searches for files based on size. `+n` finds larger files, `-n` finds smaller files.
- `-mtime n`: Finds files based on modification time. `n` represents the number of days ago.
- `-exec command {} \;`: Executes a command on each file found.
- `-print`: Displays the path names of files that match the specified criteria.
- `-maxdepth levels`: Restricts the search to a specified directory depth.
- `-mindepth levels`: Specifies the minimum directory depth for the search.
- `-empty`: Finds empty files and directories.
- `-delete`: Deletes files that match the specified criteria.
- `-execdir command {} \;`: Executes a command on each file found, from the directory containing the matched file.
- `-iname pattern`: Case-insensitive version of `-name`.

Here are some examples of how to use the `find` command:

- To find all files named `file.txt` in the current directory and all its subdirectories:

```bash
find . -name file.txt
```

- To find all directories named `dir` in the `/home` directory:

```bash
find /home -type d -name dir
```

- To find all `.png` files that are larger than 500KB in the `/home` directory:

```bash
find /home -type f -name "*.png" -size +500k
```

In conclusion, the `find` command is a powerful tool for searching files and directories in a directory hierarchy. It provides a variety of options for customizing the search and supports advanced navigation and search features¹².

While using `wc`, you can use the following options¹:

- `-l`: Prints the number of lines in a file.
- `-w`: Prints the number of words in a file.
- `-c`: Displays the count of bytes in a file.
- `-m`: Displays the count of characters in a file.
- `-L`: Prints the length of the longest line in a file.

```

In conclusion, the `wc` command is a powerful tool for counting lines, words, characters, and bytes in files or standard input¹².

# 5. cut

The `cut` command in Linux is a utility for cutting out sections from each line of files and writing the result to standard output¹². It can be used to cut parts of a line by byte position, character, and field¹².

Here's the basic syntax of the `cut` command¹:

```bash
cut [options] [file]
```

While using `cut`, you can use the following options¹:

- `-b, --bytes=LIST`: Selects only the bytes specified in LIST (e.g., -b 1-3,7).
- `-c, --characters=LIST`: Selects only the characters specified in LIST (e.g., -c 1-3,7).
- `-d, --delimiter=DELIM`: Uses DELIM as the field delimiter character instead of the tab character.
- `-f, --fields=LIST`: Selects only the fields specified in LIST, separated by the delimiter character (default is tab).
- `-n`: Do not split multi-byte characters (no effect unless -b or -c is specified).
- `--complement`: Invert the selection of fields/characters. Print the fields/characters not selected.

Here are some examples of how to use the `cut` command:

- To display the first field of each line of a file, using comma as the field delimiter:

```bash
cut -d ',' -f 1 file.txt
```

- To display the first three characters of each line of a file:

```bash
cut -c 1-3 file.txt
```

- To display all fields except the first one of each line of a file, using comma as the field delimiter:

```

- To merge all lines from the given file in separated lines²:

```bash
paste -s file1 file2
```

In conclusion, the `paste` command is a powerful tool for merging lines of files horizontally¹².
